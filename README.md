# Cylindical-Arm

It's a student project to prove our JAVA 3D skills.
Project consists of a model of cylindrical arm which we can move in diferent directions 
(up, down, rotation, putting forward and slipping in).
We can also record trajectory of a random movement (also interaction witn a primitive - in this case it's a ball).
We can change the view on the arm by pressing and moving mouse and also move closer or farther by scrolling.
